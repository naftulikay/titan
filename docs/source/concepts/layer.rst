A Titan *Layer* is a group of subnets, route tables, network ACLs, and other relevant resources all allocated for
a single logical purpose.

There are five default Titan Layers included in every Titan Network:

#. **DMZ**: Public, WAN-facing resources.
#. **Routing**: Private, layer 5-7 routing resources. (e.g. routing of TCP/UDP/HTTP packets/sessions/data)
#. **Services**: Private, usually stateless web, compute, and asynchronous worker services.
#. **Data**: Private, stateful data stores. (e.g. MySQL, Redis, Kafka, Elasticsearch)
#. **Admin**: Private, administrative services. (e.g. ZooKeeper, etcd, Logstash, Nagios)

It is possible to add additional arbitrary Titan Layers to a given Titan Network.

Layers scale to the amount of availability zones specified and support from one to five availability zones. Using an
odd number of availability zones is recommended for availability reasons (preventing split-brain scenarious in case
of network partitions).

Diagrams
--------

Isometric diagrams are provided here which show the way that Titan Layers are organized.

Small, Single-AZ Layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is a diagram of a small, single availability zone Titan Layer:

Medium, Triple-AZ Layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is a diagram of the default size of a Titan Layer, spanning three availability zones:

Large, Five-AZ Layers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
